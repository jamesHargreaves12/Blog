# James Hargreaves - Background.

# Start
In 2008, when I was ten years old, I built my first website. It was a true eyesore—think a glaringly bright blue background and clunky text. It let people know my brother and I would use Photoshop to create personalized calendars. Even though it looked terrible compared to every other site I’d visited, that tiny project changed me in a big way.

- No permission required. I could barely walk home from school by myself, and I certainly wasn’t allowed a phone. Yet there I was, putting a website on the internet. (*It did require my Dad’s credit card to cover the cost of the domain name).
- Complete control. From the hideous color scheme to the text and layout, everything was up to me. I had no idea how HTML worked, nor why it used such an odd syntax. But as a tool, I could make it do something cool
